 <h2>Rules</h2>
 <h3>The Global</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   As the first turn of the game begins, put a new global into effect. A global
   is not a card, permanent, or token; it is merely an effect that is
   constantly applied.
  </li>
  <li>
   The first global can trigger on the first turn if it has, for example, an
   upkeep trigger.
  </li>
  <li>
   The global can't be countered or destroyed; it remains until an effect
   instructs someone to change it.
  </li>
  <li>
   There can only be one global in effect at any given time. If the global is
   changed, the old global ceases to exist and the new one immediately takes
   effect.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any player can activate abilities of the global.
  </li>
  <li>
   Triggered abilities of globals don't cause themselves or other abilities
   of the same global to trigger. <i>(For example, if the global ends up being 
   something like "Whenever a player draws a card, that player draws a card," 
   it doesn't cause you to draw your whole deck the next time you draw; you 
   just draw a second card.)</i>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>The Chaos Step</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Between the upkeep and draw steps is a new step: the chaos step. At the
   beginning of each player's chaos step, that player rolls chaos. That player
   puts an ability with the generated text directly onto the stack. It isn't
   considered activated or triggered, and it is controlled by the player who
   put it there <i>(usually the player whose turn it is)</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
   If a chaos effect has modes, modes are chosen before the ability is put on
   the stack. Targets are chosen and other choices are made in the usual
   manner.
  </li>
  <li>
   Some chaos effects involve the players taking a vote. This happens at the
   same time modes would be chosen for a modal spell, and only the mode that
   won the vote goes on the stack. Then targets are chosen for that mode.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Chips</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Each player starts the game with 3 chips. Chips are not permanents; they
   are a resource that can be used to somewhat steer the chaos in your favor.
  </li>
  <li>
   A player can pay 1 chip any time he or she has priority to put one of the
   following abilities on the stack, chosen at random &mdash;
   <ul>
    <li>You may change the global.</li>
    <li>
     Counter up to one target chaos ability. If that ability is
     countered this way, its controller rolls chaos.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   A player can pay 1 chip any time he or she has priority to play the slot
   machine. To do this, that player rolls three six sided dice. On a pair, that
   player gains 2 chips. On a triple, that player gains 6 chips. On any other
   result, nothing happens.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Retribution</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If a player skips his or her chaos step when he or she shouldn't have, if it
   is still that player's turn, rewind the game state to that player's chaos
   step. Then, before rolling chaos, if there was any new information received
   as a result of skipping the chaos step <i>(for example, if the player had
   seen the card he or she would draw on his or her draw step)</i>, that player
   rolls retribution. This will cause some sort of generally negative effect to
   happen to that player.
  </li>
  <li>
   If one or more players did something in violation of the global, either by
   doing something it forbids or neglecting to do something it requires, if the
   mistake is detected before the end of the turn it was made, rewind the game
   state to the relevant point, and the player or players that made the mistake
   roll retribution.
  </li>
  <li>
   If a player changed the global without an effect instructing him or her to
   do so, that player rolls retribution.
  </li>
  <li>
   If a player made a mistake eligible for retribution but it was not detected
   until the next turn or later, that player rolls retribution, but do
   not rewind the game state.
  </li>
  <li>
   Retribution effects can't be countered, can't be replaced by replacement
   effects, and they don't cause abilities to trigger <i>(for example, if
   retribution causes you to discard a card while someone has Megrim in play,
   you won't take damage; likewise, you wouldn't be able to cast it for its
   madness cost if it had one)</i>.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Spite</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If a player would lose the game and has two or more opponents remaining who
   have not lost the game, that player rolls spite. On rare occasions,
   something might happen as a result of the spite effect that replaces the
   player losing the game; otherwise, the effect happens, then the player loses
   afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>
   Each player can only roll spite at most once per game. If you were somehow
   able to continue the game after rolling spite, you don't get to roll spite
   again, even if you lose again or an effect tells you to roll spite.
  </li>
  <li>
   Spite effects can't be countered, can't be replaced by replacement effects,
   and they don't cause abilities to trigger.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Resolution</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If for some reason the players agree to end the game early before any player
   has won, you may roll resolution to determine an arbitrary winner.
  </li>
  <li>
   If multiple players are tied for best using the criteria rolled, all other
   players lose, then roll resolution again for the remaining players.
  </li>
 </ul>
